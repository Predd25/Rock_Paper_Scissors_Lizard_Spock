# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock
This is a in depth rock, paper, scissors game with a bit of a twist. It includes multiple definitions for operators, if/elif statements, classes and try/except for error encountering. This project is different from a typical fashion of this kind of game because more variables can be added more easily than if this was just made with if/elif statements. The project is written in Python.
